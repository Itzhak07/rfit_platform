## What is RFit Platform?
The RFit Platform is a tool built for personal trainers to keep track on their tight schedule and most of all their clients.
Using the platform, you can manage your weekly/daily schedule by adding/updating/removing appointments,clients and workouts.
it was important for me to build something simple but powerful.
